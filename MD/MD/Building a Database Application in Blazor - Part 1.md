# Building a Database Application in Blazor 
# Part 1 - Project Structure and Framework

This set of articles looks at how to build and structure a real Database Application in Blazor.  There are 6 articles:

1. [Project Structure and Framework](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5279560/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-1-P)
2. [Services - Building the CRUD Data Layers](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5279596/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-2-S)
3. [View Components - CRUD Edit and View Operations in the UI](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5279963/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-3-C)
4. [UI Components - Building HTML/CSS Controls](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5280090/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-4-U)
5. [View Components - CRUD List Operations in the UI](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5280391/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-5-V)
6. [A walk through detailing how to add weather stations and weather station data to the application](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5281000/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-6-A)

The articles, which describe my current framework for developing Blazor applications, have been revised from their original release:
1. The libraries have significant coding updates, particularly in the Data Services.
2. Everything has been update to Net5.
3. The Repo home has moved.
4. Some core functionality had moved into libraries available though publically available Nuget packages.
5. Combined Server and WASM applications on the same site.
   
They are not:
1. An attempt to define best practice.
2. The finished product.

Use as much or as little as you like, and please offer suggestions.

I do make a few suggestions, principally to steer those new to Blazor away from dark holes.  As an example, I recommend parking the term `Page`.  A routed component isn't a page.  Label it a page, even subconsciously, and it gains web page attributes that simply don't apply.    I use the term **Views** after the component that displays them - `RouteView`.

This first section describes my somewhat radical development approach and walks runs through two projects on the GitHub repository - a Blazor Server and WASM/Backend API project - explaining the structure.

## Repository and Database

The repository for the articles has moved to [CEC.Blazor.SPA Repository](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.SPA).  [CEC.Blazor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor) is obselete and will be removed.

There's a SQL script in /SQL in the repository for building the database.

The Server and WASM versions of the site have been combined into a single site.  You can switch between the two in the left hand menu.  The site starts in Server mode - [https://cec-blazor-server.azurewebsites.net/](https://cec-blazor-server.azurewebsites.net/).

Serveral classes described here are part of the separate *CEC.Blazor.Core* library.  The Github is [here](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.Core), and is available as a Nuget Package.


## Solution Structure

I use Visual Studio, so the Github repository consists of a solution with five projects.  These are:

1. CEC.Blazor.SPA - the core library containing everything that can be boilerplated and reused across any project.
2. CEC.Weather - this is the library shared by both the Server and WASM projests.  Almost all the project code lives here.  Examples are the EF DB Context, Model classes, model specific CRUD components, Bootstrap SCSS, Views, Forms, ...
3. CEC.Blazor.Server - the combined Server/WASM project.
4. CEC.Blazor.WASM.Server - the WASM backend server project.  Used for testing/debugging the WASM code.
5. CEC.Blazor.WASM.Client - the WASM Client project.

Along with the standard Nuget libraries, the solution uses *CEC.Blazor.Core* which contains the ViewManager and core View management classes.

## Design Philosophy

The data side of the project is structured fairly conventionally, loosely based on the three tier - data, logical and presentation layer - model.  The exposed data classes all run as Services and are available for dependency injection.  I have adopted a record based approach to the data.  Data read from the database is immutable.  Editing uses derived edit data classes that produce new records thet are written back to the database.   The detail is covered in the second and third articles.

The UI is more radical:

1. A custom `Component` class is used as the base UI component - `ComponentBase` is only used by the out-of-the-box data controls.
2. Routing is discarded.  There's a new `ViewManager` that manages the UI.

## UI Structure

### Pages

Pages are the web pages that act as the host for the the application.  There's normally one per application.

### ViewManager

The `ViewManager` is the sub-root component in the RenderTree, loaded by App.  It's purpose is to manage and load Views.  The supporting `ViewData` class is used to store View configuration data.  The main  method used is `LoadViewAsync`.  There are various versions, but all load the View defined in `ViewData`.  `ViewManager` exposes itself to all other components through a cascading value.

### Views

Views are the components loaded into the page by `ViewManager`.  They must implement `IView` and can define a Layout.

```c#
    public interface IView : IComponent
    {
        /// provides a unique reference for the instance of the view
        public Guid GUID => Guid.NewGuid();

        /// The cascaded ViewManager Instance
        [CascadingParameter] public ViewManager ViewManager { get; set; }
    }
```

### Layouts

Layouts are the Blazor out-of-the-box Layouts.  The ViewManager renders the Layout with the `View` as the child content.

### Forms

Forms are logical collections of controls that are either displayed in a view or a modal dialog.  Lists, view forms, edit forms are all classic forms. Forms contain controls not HTML.

### Controls

Controls are components that display something: they emit HTML code.  For example, an edit box, a dropdown, button, ... A Form is a collection of controls.

## CEC.Blazor.WASM.Client Project

![Project Files](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC-Publish/blob/master/Images/CEC.Blazor.WASM.Client-2.png?raw=true)

The project is almost empty.  The controls and services are all in the libraries.  It contains only the code needed to build the WASM executable.

### Program.cs

`CEC.Blazor` and local application services are loaded.  Note the Blazor root component is defined here.  You don't have to use `App`.

```c#
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
    // Full class name used here to make it a little more obvious.  Not required if the assemble is referenced.
    builder.RootComponents.Add<CEC.Weather.Components.App>("app");

    // Added here as we don't have access to builder in AddApplicationServices
    builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
    // the Services for the CEC.Blazor Library
    builder.Services.AddCECBlazorSPA();
    // the local application Services defined in ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs
    builder.Services.AddApplicationServices();

    await builder.Build().RunAsync();
}
```
Services for each project/library are specified in `IServiceCollection` Extensions.

#### ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

The site specific services loaded are the controller service `WeatherForecastControllerService` and the data service as an `IWeatherForecastDataService` interface loading  `WeatherForecastWASMDataService`.  The final transient service is the Fluent Validator for the Edit form.

```c#
public static class ServiceCollectionExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddApplicationServices(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Scoped service for the WASM Client version of WASM Factory Data Service 
        services.AddScoped<IFactoryDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>, FactoryWASMDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>>();
        // Scoped service for the WeatherForecast Controller Services
        services.AddScoped<WeatherForecastControllerService>();
        services.AddScoped<WeatherStationControllerService>();
        services.AddScoped<WeatherReportControllerService>();
        return services;
    }
}
```

### CEC.Blazor.WASM.Server Project

The *CEC.Blazor.WASM.Server* project only exists for debugging the WASM project.  All files are copies of the originals from *CEC.Blazor.Server*.

![Project Files](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.SPA/blob/master/Images/CEC-Blazor-SPA-WASM-Server-Project-View.png?raw=true)

The only files in the server project, other than error handling for anyone trying to navigate to the site, are the WeatherForecast Controller and the startup/program files.

#### ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

The site specific service is a singleton `IWeatherForecastDataService` interface loading either `WeatherForecastServerDataService` or `WeatherForecastDummyDataService`. `WeatherForecastDummyDataService` is for demo purposes and doesn't need a backend SQL database. It does what it says, creates an in-application dataset.  

```c#
public static class ServiceCollectionExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddApplicationServices(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // You have a choice of data sources.
        // services.AddSingleton<IFactoryDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>, FactoryServerDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>>();
        services.AddSingleton<IFactoryDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>, WeatherDummyDataService>();

        // Factory for building the DBContext 
        var dbContext = configuration.GetValue<string>("Configuration:DBContext");
        services.AddDbContextFactory<WeatherForecastDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(dbContext), ServiceLifetime.Singleton);
        return services;
    }
}
```

#### Startup.cs

Note that the default endpoint is set to *wwwroot/wasm.html*.

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{

    services.AddControllersWithViews();
    services.AddRazorPages();
    services.AddApplicationServices(Configuration);
}

// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        app.UseWebAssemblyDebugging();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        endpoints.MapControllers();
        // default endpoint set to the file: wwwroot/wasm.html
        endpoints.MapFallbackToFile("wasm.html");
    });
}
```
### wasm.html

`wasm.html` is an almost out-of-the-box  `index.html` with:

1. Added stylesheet references.  Note that you use the virtual directory `_content/Assembly_Name` to access content exposed in the `wwwroot` folders of dependency assembles and the reference to the component styling - `CEC.Weather.WASM.Server.styles.css`.  Scripts are accessed in the same way.
2. The base content of `app` is an HTML block that displays a spinner while the application is initializing. 

![App Start Screen](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.SPA/blob/master/Images/WASM-Start-Screen.png?raw=true)

```html

    <div id="app">
        <div class="mt-4" style="margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; width:100%;">
            <div class="loader"></div>
            <div style="width:100%; text-align:center;"><h4>Web Application Loading</h4></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="blazor-error-ui">
        An unhandled error has occurred.
        <a href="" class="reload">Reload</a>
        <a class="dismiss">🗙</a>
    </div>
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>
    <script src="_content/CEC.Blazor.SPA/site.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```
### CSS

All CSS is shared, so lives in `CEC.Weather`.  I use Bootstrap, customized a little with SASS.  I have the WEB COMPILER extension installed in Visual Studio to compile SASS files on the fly.

### CEC.Blazor.Server Project

![Project Files](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.SPA/blob/master/Images/CEC-Weather-Server-Project-View.png?raw=true)

#### Pages

We have one real page - the standard issue `_Host.cshtml`.  As we're running on the server this is an asp.netcore page.
1. Added stylesheet references.  Note that you use the virtual directory `_content/Assembly_Name` to access content exposed in the `wwwroot` folders of dependency assembles and the reference to the component styling - `CEC.Weather.WASM.Server.styles.css`..  Scripts are accessed in the same way.
2. The base content of `app` uses a TagHelper to load the root component - in this case `CEC.Weather.Components.App`.  Again, you're not tied to App, just specify a different component class. 

```c#
@page "/"
@namespace CEC.Blazor.Server.Pages
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@{
    Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CEC.Blazor.Server</title>
    <base href="~/" />
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito:200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i,900,900i" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="CEC.Weather.Server.styles.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="_content/CEC.Blazor/cec.blazor.min.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="_content/CEC.Weather/css/site.min.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <app>
        <component type="typeof(CEC.Weather.Components.App)" render-mode="Server" />
    </app>

    <div id="blazor-error-ui">
        <environment include="Staging,Production">
            An error has occurred. This application may no longer respond until reloaded.
        </environment>
        <environment include="Development">
            An unhandled exception has occurred. See browser dev tools for details.
        </environment>
        <a href="" class="reload">Reload</a>
        <a class="dismiss">🗙</a>
    </div>
    <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script src="_content/CEC.Blazor/site.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
### wasm.html

`wasm.html` is a copy of `wasm.html` from the *CEC.Weather.WASM.Server*.  It's the entry point for the WASM version of the application.

#### Startup.cs

The local services and `CEC.Blazor` library services are added.

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
    services.AddRazorPages();
    services.AddServerSideBlazor();
    services.AddCECBlazorSPA();
    services.AddApplicationServices();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        endpoints.MapControllers();
        endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
    });
}
```

#### ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

The site specific services are a singleton `IWeatherForecastDataService` interface loading either `WeatherForecastServerDataService` or `WeatherForecastDummyDataService`, a scoped `WeatherForecastControllerService` and a transient Fluent Validator service for the Editor.

```c#
public static IServiceCollection AddApplicationServices(this IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IFactoryDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>, WeatherDummyDataService>();
    // services.AddSingleton<IFactoryDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>, FactoryServerDataService<WeatherForecastDbContext>>();
    services.AddScoped<WeatherForecastControllerService>();
    services.AddScoped<WeatherStationControllerService>();
    services.AddScoped<WeatherReportControllerService>();
    // Factory for building the DBContext 
    var dbContext = configuration.GetValue<string>("Configuration:DBContext");
    services.AddDbContextFactory<WeatherForecastDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(dbContext), ServiceLifetime.Singleton);
    return services;
}
```

### Wrap Up
That wraps up this section.  It's a bit of an overview, with a lot more detail to come later.  Hopefully it demonstrates the level of abstraction you can achieve with Blazor projects.  The next section looks at Services and implementing the data layers.

Some key points to note:
1. Almost all the code is common across Blazor Server and Blazor WASM projects.  With care you can write an application that can be deployed either way.
2. Be very careful about the terminology.  We don't have "Pages" in the application.

## History

* 15-Sep-2020: Initial version
* 17-Nov-2020: Major Blazor.CEC library changes.  Change to ViewManager from Router and new Component base implementation.
* 7-Feb-2021: Major updates to Services, project structure and daa editing
